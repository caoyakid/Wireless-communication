## Topic: Angular-domain ULA Radiation/Reception
According to the angular-domain model, evaluate the Radiation and Reception patterns of uniform linear arrays(ULA)  

### Input parameters:
- The number of antenna elements N
- The normalized antenna separation "delta" (normalized to the wavelength lambda_c)
- SIMO(reception) or MISO(radiation)
- The radiation or reception directions of the desired signal(s)
- The radiation or reception direction of the interference signal  

### Output results:
- The angular-domain radiation/reception basis
- The correlation between different basis vectors
- The gain pattern of the ULA
- The gain of the desired signal for using different radiation/reception beams
- The signal-to-interference power ratio(SIR) for using different beams
- The SIR of multiple input signals(multiple reception directions) with diversity combing(considering fading for the signals and interferences)
- ...(Any results that can present your work better)
